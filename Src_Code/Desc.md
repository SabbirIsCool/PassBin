# Description for source code.
My app *PassBin* is created upon a function called
*SecPassGen*, which generates and prints passwords.
This function is the foundation of my app. It is written
in the *SecPassGen.py* file. If you want to create
a program based on creating randomly generated
password(or related to it), you can check and copy the
function there.

Also, I included the main function instead of the whole source code.
Because the rest of the code is just about printing texts, getting
inputs from user and filtering the inputs to get integers(like 5) instead
of floating numbers(like 5.4 or 5.0) and numerical nouns(like 'five'); 
because the program can **NOT** work with those datas. Plus I accidently
deleted the whole codes after making the *PassBin* app. So I had to
rewrite the whole function.

***Happy Coding ;)***
