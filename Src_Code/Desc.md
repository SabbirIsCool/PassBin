# Description for source code.
My app *PassBin* is created upon a function called
*SecPassGen*, which generates and prints passwords.
This function is the foundation of my app. It is written
in the *SecPassGen.py* file. If you want to create
a program based on creating randomly generated
password(or related to it), you can check and copy the
function there.

***Happy Coding ;)***
